## About this Project
Earthdata Search is a web application developed by [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov)
to enable data discovery, search, comparison, visualization, and access across EOSDIS' Earth Science data holdings.
It builds upon several public-facing services provided by EOSDIS, including
the [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/) for data discovery and access,
EOSDIS [User Registration System (URS)](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov) authentication,
the [Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs) for visualization,
and a number of OPeNDAP services hosted by data providers.

## Components

In addition to the main project, we have open sourced stand-alone components built for
Earthdata Search as separate projects with the "edsc-" (Earthdata Search components) prefix.

 * Our timeline: https://github.com/nasa/edsc-timeline
 * Our ECHO forms implementation: https://github.com/nasa/edsc-echoforms

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Ruby 2.1.2
* [Pow](http://pow.cx/) is recommended for local testing with Earthdata Login
* A Ruby manager such as [RVM](http://rvm.io/) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is strongly recommended.
* (For shapefile support) access to an [ogre](http://ogre.adc4gis.com) server
* (For placename completion) a [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org) account

Additionally, you will need the following, which will be installed automatically by `bin/setup` on most UNIX-like systems:

* Postgres development headers
  * Mac (homebrew): `brew install postgresql`
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y libpq-dev`
  * RHEL: `sudo yum install -y postgresql-devel`

* Node.js (with npm)
  * Mac (homebrew): `brew install node`
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
  * RHEL: `sudo curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup | bash - && sudo yum install -y nodejs`

### Earthdata Login (URS) Configuration

If you would like to set up Earthdata Login login, you will need to perform the following steps:

Register an account on [the Earthdata Login home page](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home)

Create an application in the Earthdata Login console.  Its callback URL should be `http://<domain>/urs_callback`.  If you are using Pow, this will be something
like `http://earthdata-search.dev/urs_callback`

Click the "Feedback" icon on the Earthdata Login page and request that your new application be placed in the ECHO application group
(required for ECHO/CMR to recognize your tokens).

Modify line 37 of `config/services.yml` to contain your Earthdata Login application's client ID

### Application configuration

If using Pow, create a symlink to your application directory, for instance `ln -s $(pwd) ~/.pow/earthdata-search`
(making your app available at `http://earthdata-search.dev`).  If you set up Earthdata Login, ensure that the domain matches
the callback URL specified in Earthdata Login.

### Initial setup

Run

    bin/setup

Open `config/application.yml` and edit configuration values as described in that file to set up Earthdata Login, shapefile support,
and placename completion as appropriate.

### Running

If you set up Pow, simply visit `http://earthdata-search.dev`,
otherwise run `rails s` in the project directory and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
