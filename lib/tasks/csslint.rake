    # CSSLint::TestTask evaluates its constructor block immediately, which
    # means the list of CSS files gets set as soon as this file is loaded.
    # We subsequently clobber the assets directory and re-generate it,
    # which means CSSLint looks for files that don't exist.  This class
    # is an enumerable-like class that only fetches the asset files when
    # it's time to actually iterate over them.
